  \section{Projects}
  I will now briefly describe the two projects that will be discussed during this document/KSBs. More detail will be added to these projects throughout the
  multiple KSBs.
  
  \subsection{Off Product Inspector (OPI)}
  The Off Product Inspector (OPI) is a tool used by internal members of the BBC to view what media we offer to both internal and external partners. The tool 
  has two main functions:


  \begin{enumerate}
    \item To provide a search mechanism on all brand/series/episodes metadata that partners can access.
    \item To provide a tool that generates per partner specific links to catered or promotional data.
  \end{enumerate}

  The metadata we provide partners is written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and can be hard to read, as a lot of the people are non-technical we provide
  a web based GUI for users to navigate and browse the data.

  \end{figure}
  
  The \textit{'Deeplink Generator'} is another part of the OPI that allows users to generate links to promotional/catered content. In the past links have been 
  malformed causing errors for partners, this tool aims to fix that by not having to manually write the links ourselves.

  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Schedules}
  The BBC plan to deprecate a service called \textit{'Nitro'} in order to save money on running the service and licenses attached to the service. As part of this
  certain data the service provided now has to supplied elsewhere. My team is responsible for supplying external partners with the schedule/EPG information.
  
  This data contains what is on linear television at what time, and also includes the aforementioned episode/series/brand metadata. In the real world this data
  is seen when you click 'guide' or corresponding button on the TV remote.
